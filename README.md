Advanced Social Media Mini Project

This project is based on Online Reputation Management (ORM) for the luxury fashion brand Luvious Viton (LV). It was created as part of the Advanced Social Media and Analytics (23CAH-303) course under the guidance of Ms. Ankita. The main aim of this project is to study and analyze how LV manages its online image, customer feedback, and brand presence on different social media platforms. The project report includes details such as sentiment analysis, customer reviews, complaints, company responses, SWOT analysis, and recommendations to improve the brand’s reputation and customer trust.

Various online tools such as Social Mention, Google Alerts, Twitter/X, YouTube, and Trustpilot were used to collect and analyze data. The findings show that LV has a mostly positive online reputation, but there are also some challenges like pricing concerns and limited product availability. The report suggests strategies such as better customer communication, real-time ORM tools, and promoting user-generated content to build a stronger and more transparent image of the brand.
